            "text": "Configuring libStorage\n\n\nTweak this, turn that, peek behind the curtain...\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThis page reviews how to configure \nlibStorage\n to suit any environment,\nbeginning with the the most common use cases, exploring recommended guidelines,\nand finally, delving into the details of more advanced settings.\n\n\nClient/Server Configuration\n\n\nExcept when specified otherwise, the configuration examples below assume the\n\nlibStorage\n client and server exist on the same host. However, that is not at\nall a requirement. It is fully possible, and in fact the entire purpose of\n\nlibStorage\n, that the client and server be able to function on different\nsystems. One \nlibStorage\n server should be able to support hundreds of clients.\nYet for the sake of completeness, the examples below show both configurations\nmerged.\n\n\nWhen configuring a \nlibStorage\n client and server for different systems, there\nwill be a few differences from the examples below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe examples show \nlibStorage\n configured with its server component hosted\n    on a UNIX socket. This is ideal for when the client/server exist on the same\n    host as it reduces security risks. However, in most real-world scenarios\n    the client and server are \nnot\n residing on the same host, the\n    \nlibStorage\n  server should use a TCP endpoint so it can be accessed\n    remotely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a distributed configuration the actual driver configuration sections\n    need only occur on the server-side. The entire purpose of \nlibStorage\n's\n    distributed nature is to enable clients without any knowledge of how to\n    access a storage platform the ability to connect to a remote server that\n    maintains that storage platform access information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Configuration\n\n\nThis section outlines the most common configuration scenarios encountered by\n\nlibStorage\n's users.\n\n\nSimple\n\n\nThe first example is a simple \nlibStorage\n configuration with the VirtualBox\nstorage driver. The below example omits the host property, but the configuration\nis still valid. If the \nlibstorage.host\n property is not found, the server is\nhosted via a temporary UNIX socket file in \n/var/run/libstorage\n.\n\n\n\n\nnote\n\n\nPlease remember to replace the placeholders in the following examples\nwith values valid for the systems on which the examples are executed.\n\n\nThe example below specifies the \nvolumePath\n property as\n\n$HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n. While the text \n$HOME\n will be replaced with\nthe actual value for that environment variable at runtime, the path may\nstill be invalid. The \nvolumePath\n property should reflect a path on the\nsystem on which the VirtualBox server is running, and that is not always\nthe same system on which the \nlibStorage\n server is running.\n\n\nSo please, make sure to update the \nvolumePath\n property for the VirtualBox\ndriver to a path valid on the system on which the VirtualBox server is\nrunning.\n\n\nThe same goes for VirtualBox property \nendpoint\n as the VirtualBox\nweb service is not always available at \n10.0.2.2:18083\n.\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\nTCP\n\n\nThe following example illustrates how to configure a \nlibStorage\n client and\nserver running on the same host. The server has one endpoint on which it is\naccessible - a single TCP port, 7979, bound to the localhost network interface.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  host: tcp://127.0.0.1:7979\n  server:\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\nTCP+TLS\n\n\nThe following example illustrates how to configure a \nlibStorage\n client and\nserver running on the same host. The server has one endpoint on which it is\naccessible - a single TCP port, 7979, bound to all of the host's network\ninterfaces. This means that the server is accessible via external clients, not\njust those running on the same host.\n\n\nBecause of the public nature of this \nlibStorage\n server, it is a good idea to\nencrypt communications between client and server.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  host: tcp://127.0.0.1:7979\n  client:\n    tls: true\n  server:\n    tls:\n      certFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.crt\n      keyFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.key\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnote\n\n\nPlease note that in the above example the property \nlibstorage.client\n has\nbeen introduced. This property is always present, even if not explicitly\nspecified. It exists to override \nlibStorage\n properties for the client\nonly, such as TLS settings, logging, etc.\n\n\n\n\nUNIX Socket\n\n\nFor the security conscious, there is no safer way to run a client/server setup\non a single system than the option to use a UNIX socket. The socket offloads\nauthentication and relies on the file system file access to ensure authorized\nusers can use the \nlibStorage\n API.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  host: unix:///var/run/libstorage/localhost.sock\n  server:\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to apply TLS to the UNIX socket. Refer to the TCP+TLS section\nfor applying TLS to the UNIX sockets.\n\n\nMultiple Endpoints\n\n\nThere may be occasions when it is desirable to provide multiple ingress vectors\nfor the \nlibStorage\n API. In these situations, configuring multiple endpoints\nis the solution. The below example illustrates how to configure three endpoints:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nendpoint\n\n\nprotocol\n\n\naddress\n\n\ntls\n\n\nlocalhost only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsock\n\n\nunix socket\n\n\n/var/run/libstorage/localhost.sock\n\n\nno\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprivate\n\n\ntcp\n\n\n127.0.0.1:7979\n\n\nno\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\npublic\n\n\ntcp\n\n\n*:7980\n\n\nyes\n\n\nno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  host: unix:///var/run/libstorage/localhost.sock\n  server:\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n    endpoints:\n      sock:\n        address: unix:///var/run/libstorage/localhost.sock\n      private:\n        address: tcp://127.0.0.1:7979\n      public:\n        address: tcp://:7980\n        tls:\n          certFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.crt\n          keyFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.key\n          trustedCertsFile: /etc/libstorage/trusted-certs.crt\n          clientCertRequired: true\n\n\n\n\nWith all three endpoints defined explicitly in the above example, why leave the\nproperty \nlibstorage.host\n in the configuration at all? When there are no\nendpoints defined, the \nlibStorage\n server will attempt to create a default\nendpoint using the value from the property \nlibstorage.host\n. However, even\nwhen there's at least one explicitly defined endpoint, the \nlibstorage.host\n\nproperty still serves a very important function -- it is the property used\nby the \nlibStorage\n client to determine which to which endpoint to connect.\n\n\nMultiple Services\n\n\nAll of the previous examples have used the VirtualBox storage driver as the\nsole measure of how to configure a \nlibStorage\n service. However, it is possible\nto configure many services at the same time in order to provide access to\nmultiple storage drivers of different types, or even different configurations\nof the same driver.\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to configure three \nlibStorage\n services:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nservice\n\n\ndriver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvirtualbox-00\n\n\nvirtualbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvirtualbox-01\n\n\nvirtualbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscaleio\n\n\nscaleio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the \nvirtualbox-01\n service includes an added \nintegration\n section.\nThe integration definition refers to the integration interface and parameters\nspecific to incoming requests through this layer. In this case we defined\n\nlibstorage.server.services.virtualbox-01\n with the\n\nintegration.volume.operations.create.default.size\n parameter set. This enables all\ncreate requests that come in through \nvirtualbox-01\n to have a default size of\n1GB. So although it is technically the same platform below the covers,\n\nvirtualbox-00\n requests may have different default values than those defined\nin \nvirtualbox-01\n.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    services:\n      virtualbox-00:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes-00\n          controllerName: SATA\n      virtualbox-01:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes-01\n          controllerName: SATA\n        integration:\n          volume:\n            operations:\n              create:\n                default:\n                  size: 1 # GB\n      scaleio:\n        driver: scaleio\n        scaleio:\n          endpoint: https://gateway_ip/api\n          insecure: true\n          userName: username\n          password: password\n          systemName: tenantName\n          protectionDomainName: protectionDomainName\n          storagePoolName: storagePoolName\n\n\n\n\nA very important point to make about the relationship between services and\nendpoints is that all configured services are available on all endpoints. In\nthe future this may change, and \nlibStorage\n may support endpoint-specific\nservice definitions, but for now if a service is configured, it is accessible\nvia any of the available endpoint addresses.\n\n\nBetween the three services above, clearly one major difference is that two\nservices host one driver, VirtualBox, and the third service hosts ScaleIO.\nHowever, why two services for one driver, in this case, VirtualBox? Because,\nin addition to services being configured to host different types of drivers,\nservices can also host different driver configurations. In service\n\nvirtualbox-00\n, the volume path is \n$HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes-00\n,\nwhereas for service \nvirtualbox-01\n, the volume path is\n\n$HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes-01\n.\n\n\nLogging\n\n\nSometimes it helps to see a little more, or maybe even a little less,\ninformation in the logs. Configuring logging is quite straight-forward:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  logging:\n    level: warn\n  server:\n    logging:\n      level: info\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\nThe \nlibStorage\n configuration shown above uses a global log level of \nwarn\n,\nand a more verbose, \ninfo\n log level for just the server.\n\n\nAdvanced Configuration\n\n\nThe following sections detail every last aspect of how \nlibStorage\n works and can\nbe configured.\n\n\nTLS Configuration\n\n\nThis section reviews the several supported TLS configuration options.\n\n\nInsecure TLS\n\n\nThe following example illustrates how to configure the libStorage client to\nskip validation of a provided server-side certificate:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  host: tcp://127.0.0.1:7979\n  client:\n    tls: insecure\n  server:\n    tls:\n      certFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.crt\n      keyFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.key\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnote\n\n\nThe above example instructs the client-side TLS configuration to operate in\n\ninsecure\n mode. This means the client is not attempting to verify the\ncertificate provided by the server. This is a security risk and should not\never be used in production.\n\n\n\n\nServer Cert Fingerprint\n\n\nWhile TLS should never be configured as insecure in production, a compromise\nbetween no TLS and insecure TLS is specifying a server certificate's SHA256\nfingerprint.\n\n\nFor example, the following command can be used to print google.com's SHA256\nfingerprint:\n\n\n$ openssl s_client -connect google.com:443  \n/dev/null | \\\n  sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' | \\\n  openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256\n\n\n\n\nThe above command will produce output similar to the following:\n\n\ndepth=2 /C=US/O=GeoTrust Inc./CN=GeoTrust Global CA\nverify error:num=20:unable to get local issuer certificate\nverify return:0\nDONE\nSHA256 Fingerprint=15:92:77:BE:6C:90:D3:FB:59:29:9C:51:A7:DB:5C:16:55:BD:B9:9E:E7:7E:C1:9B:30:C3:74:99:21:5F:08:99\n\n\n\n\nUsing the above output, it's possible to configure a libStorage client to\ncommunicate to a remote, libStorage API endpoint using TLS if, and only if,\nthe fingerprint of remote endpoint's certificate matches the one the client\nexpects. The following configuration achieves just that:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  host: tcp://127.0.0.1:7979\n  client:\n    tls: \nsha256:15:92:77:BE:6C:90:D3:FB:59:29:9C:51:A7:DB:5C:16:55:BD:B9:9E:E7:7E:C1:9B:30:C3:74:99:21:5F:08:99\n\n  server:\n    tls:\n      certFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.crt\n      keyFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.key\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\nWith \nDEBUG\n level logging enabled, the libStorage client logs reflect the\nmatched fingerprint:\n\n\nDEBU[0000] comparing tls fingerprints                    actualFingerprint=159277be6c90d3fb59299c51a7db5c1655bdb99ee77ec19b30c37499215f0899 expectedFingerprint=159277be6c90d3fb59299c51a7db5c1655bdb99ee77ec19b30c37499215f0899 service=virtualbox storageDriver=libstorage time=1488821773182\nDEBU[0000] matched tls fingerprints                      actualFingerprint=159277be6c90d3fb59299c51a7db5c1655bdb99ee77ec19b30c37499215f0899 expectedFingerprint=159277be6c90d3fb59299c51a7db5c1655bdb99ee77ec19b30c37499215f0899 service=virtualbox storageDriver=libstorage time=1488821773182\n\n\n\n\nTrusted Certs File\n\n\nThis TLS configuration example describes how to instruct the libStorage client\nto validate the provided server-side certificate using a custom trusted CA file.\nThis avoids the perils of insecure TLS while still enabling a privately signed\nor snake-oil server-side certificate.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  host: tcp://127.0.0.1:7979\n  client:\n    tls:\n      trustedCertsFile: $HOME/.libstorage/trusted-certs.crt\n  server:\n    tls:\n      certFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.crt\n      keyFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.key\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\nRequire Client-Side Certs\n\n\nThe final TLS example explains how to configure the libStorage server to\nto require certificates from clients. This configuration enables the use of\nclient-side certificates as a means of authorization.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  host: tcp://127.0.0.1:7979\n  client:\n    tls:\n      certFile: $HOME/.libstorage/libstorage-client.crt\n      keyFile: $HOME/.libstorage/libstorage-client.key\n      trustedCertsFile: $HOME/.libstorage/trusted-certs.crt\n  server:\n    tls:\n      certFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.crt\n      keyFile: /etc/libstorage/libstorage-server.key\n      trustedCertsFile: /etc/libstorage/trusted-certs.crt\n      clientCertRequired: true\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\nA typical scenario that employs the above example would also involve the\nserver certificate to have a dual purpose as an intermediate signing authority\nthat has signed the allowed client certificates. Or at the very least the\nserver certificate would be signed by the same intermediate CA that is used\nto sign the client-side certs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nIn addition to TLS, the libStorage API includes support for\n\nJSON Web Tokens\n (JWT) in order to provide authentication\nand authorization.\n\n\nA JWT is transmitted along with an API call in the standard HTTP \nAuthorization\n\nheader as an OAuth 2.0 \nBearer\n token. For\nexample:\n\n\nGET /volumes\n\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1MjI2ODg1NTAsImlhdCI6MTQ5MTIzODk1MCwibmJmIjoxNDkxMjM4OTUwLCJzdWIiOiJha3V0eiJ9.3eAA7AQZUGrwA42H64qKbu8QF_AHpSsJSMR0FALnKj8\n\n\n\n\nThe above token is split into three discreet parts:\n\n\nHEADER\n.\nPAYLOAD\n.\nSIGNATURE\n\n\nThe decoded header is:\n\n\n{\n  \nalg\n: \nHS256\n,\n  \ntyp\n: \nJWT\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe decoded payload is:\n\n\n{\n  \nexp\n: 1522688550,\n  \niat\n: 1491238950,\n  \nnbf\n: 1491238950,\n  \nsub\n: \nakutz\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe signature is the result of signing the concatenation of the header and\nsignature after Base64 encoding them both.\n\n\nGlobal Configuration\n\n\nIt's possible to provision access to the libStorage API both globally and per\nservice. For example, the below configuration restricts all access to the\nlibStorage API to the bearer token from above:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    auth:\n      key: MySuperSecretSigningKey\n      alg: HS256\n      allow:\n      - akutz\n\n\n\n\nThe above configuration snippet defines a new property,\n\nlibstorage.server.auth\n which contains the following child properties:\n\nkey\n, \nalg\n, \nallow\n, \ndeny\n, and \ndisabled\n.\n\n\nThe property \nlibstorage.server.auth.key\n is the secret key used to verify\nthe signatures of the tokens included in API calls. If the property's value\nis a valid file path then the contents of the file are used as the key. The\nvalue of \nlibstorage.server.auth.alg\n specifies the cryptographic algorithm\nused to sign and verify the tokens. It has a default value of \nHS256\n. Valid\nalgorithms include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm\n\n\nStrength\n\n\nConfig Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECDSA\n\n\n256\n\n\nES256\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n384\n\n\nES384\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n512\n\n\nES512\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHMAC\n\n\n256\n\n\nHS256\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n384\n\n\nHS384\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n512\n\n\nHS512\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSA-PSS\n\n\n256\n\n\nPS256\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n384\n\n\nPS384\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n512\n\n\nPS512\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSA\n\n\n256\n\n\nRS256\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n384\n\n\nRS384\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n512\n\n\nRS512\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the properties \nlibstorage.server.auth.allow\n and\n\nlibstorage.server.auth.deny\n are arrays of strings.\n\n\nThe values can be either the subject of the token, the entire, encoded JWT, or\nthe format \ntag:encodedJWT\n. The prefix \ntag:\n can be any piece of text in\norder to provide a friendly means of identifying the encoded JWT.\n\n\nThe \nallow\n property indicates which tokens are valid and the \ndeny\n property\nis a way to explicitly revoke access.\n\n\n\n\nnote\n\n\nPlease be aware that by virtue of defining the property\n\nlibstorage.server.auth.allow\n, access to the server is restricted to\nrequests with valid tokens only and anonymous access is no longer allowed.\n\n\n\n\nThere may be occasions when it is necessary to temporarily disable token-based\naccess restrictions. It's possible to do this without removing the token\nconfiguration by setting the property \nlibstorage.server.auth.disabled\n\nto a boolean true value:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    auth:\n      disabled: true\n      key:      MySuperSecretSigningKey\n      allow:\n      - akutz\n\n\n\n\nService Configuration\n\n\nThe previous section described how to restrict access at the global level.\nThis section reviews service-level token configurations.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    services:\n      ebs-00:\n        driver: ebs\n        auth:\n          key: MySuperSecretSigningKey\n          allow:\n          - akutz\n      ebs-01:\n        driver: ebs\n\n\n\n\nThe above configuration defines a token configuration for the service \nebs-00\n\nbut \nnot\n the service \nebs-01\n. That means that API calls to the resource\n\n/volumes/ebs-00\n require a valid token whereas API calls to the resource\n\n/volumes/ebs-01\n do not.\n\n\n\n\nnote\n\n\nIf an API call without a token is submitted that acts on multiple\nresources and one or more of those resources is configured for token-based\naccess then the call  will result in an HTTP status of 401 \nUnauthorized\n.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal vs. Service\n\n\nIt is also possible to configure both global token-based access at the same\ntime as service token-based access. However, there are some important details\nof which to be aware when doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen combining global and service token configurations, only the global\ntoken key is respected. Otherwise tokens would always be invalid either at\nthe global or service scope since a token is signed by a single key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe global \nallow\n list grants access globally but can be overridden by\nincluding a token in a service's \ndeny\n list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe global \ndeny\n list restricts access globally and cannot be overridden\nby including a token in a service's \nallow\n list. For example, consider the\nfollowing configuration snippet:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    auth:\n      key:   MySuperSecretSigningKey\n      allow:\n      - akutz\n      deny:\n      - cduchesne\n    services:\n      ebs-00:\n        driver: ebs\n        auth:\n          allow:\n          - cduchesne\n\n\n\nThe above example defines a global deny list. That means that even though\nthe service \nebs-00\n includes \ncduchesne\n in its own allow list, requests\nto service \nebs-00\n with \ncduchesne\n's bearer token are denied because\nthat token is denied globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClient Config\n\n\nUp until now the discussion surrounding security tokens has been centered on\nserver-side configuration. However, the libStorage client can also be\nconfigured to send tokens as part of its standard API call workflow. For\nexample:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  client:\n    auth:\n      token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1MjI2ODg1NTAsImlhdCI6MTQ5MTIzODk1MCwibmJmIjoxNDkxMjM4OTUwLCJzdWIiOiJha3V0eiJ9.3eAA7AQZUGrwA42H64qKbu8QF_AHpSsJSMR0FALnKj8\n\n\n\n\nThe above client-side configuration snippet defines the property\n\nlibstorage.client.auth.token\n, the JWT used for outgoing HTTP calls as\nthe bearer token.\n\n\nThe value of the \nlibstorage.client.auth.token\n property can also be a valid\nfile path. The contents of the file will be read from disk and treated as the\nencoded token string.\n\n\nEmbedded Configuration\n\n\nIf \nlibStorage\n is embedded into another application, such as\n\nREX-Ray\n, then that application may\nmanage its own configuration and supply the embedded \nlibStorage\n instance\ndirectly with a configuration object. In this scenario, the \nlibStorage\n\nconfiguration files are ignored in deference to the embedding application.\n\n\nData Directories\n\n\nThe first time \nlibStorage\n is executed it will create several directories if\nthey do not already exist:\n\n\n\n\n/etc/libstorage\n\n\n/var/log/libstorage\n\n\n/var/run/libstorage\n\n\n/var/lib/libstorage\n\n\n\n\nThe above directories will contain configuration files, logs, PID files, and\nmounted volumes. However, the location of these directories can also be\ninfluenced with the environment variable \nLIBSTORAGE_HOME\n. All of the above\ndata directories will be placed in their same paths, but prefixed by the path\nspecified via \nLIBSTORAGE_HOME\n, if \nLIBSTORAGE_HOME\n is in fact specified.\n\n\nConfiguration Methods\n\n\nThere are three ways to configure \nlibStorage\n:\n\n\n\n\nCommand line options\n\n\nEnvironment variables\n\n\nConfiguration files\n\n\n\n\nThe order of the items above is also the order of precedence when considering\noptions set in multiple locations that may override one another. Values set\nvia CLI flags have the highest order of precedence, followed by values set by\nenvironment variables, followed, finally, by values set in configuration files.\n\n\nConfiguration Files\n\n\nThere are two \nlibStorage\n configuration files - global and user:\n\n\n\n\n/etc/libstorage/config.yml\n\n\n$HOME/.libstorage/config.yml\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that while the user configuration file is located inside the user's\nhome directory, this is the directory of the user that starts \nlibStorage\n. And\nif \nlibStorage\n is being started as a service, then \nsudo\n is likely being used,\nwhich means that \n$HOME/.libstorage/config.yml\n won't point to \nyour\n home\ndirectory, but rather \n/root/.libstorage/config.yml\n.\n\n\nConfiguration Properties\n\n\nThe section \nConfiguration Methods\n mentions there are\nthree ways to configure libStorage: config files, environment variables, and the\ncommand line. However, this section will illuminate the relationship between the\nnames of the configuration file properties, environment variables, and CLI\nflags.\n\n\nBelow is a simple configuration file that tells the \nlibStorage\n client where\nthe \nlibStorage\n server is hosted:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  host: tcp://192.168.0.20:7979\n\n\n\n\nThe property \nlibstorage.host\n is a string. This value can also be set via\nenvironment variables or the command line, but to do so requires knowing the\nnames of the environment variables or CLI flags to use. Luckily those are very\neasy to figure out just by knowing the property names.\n\n\nAll properties that might appear in the \nlibStorage\n configuration file\nfall under some type of heading. For example, take the default configuration\nabove.\n\n\nThe rule for environment variables is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nEach nested level becomes a part of the environment variable name followed\n    by an underscore \n_\n except for the terminating part.\n\n\nThe entire environment variable name is uppercase.\n\n\n\n\nNested properties follow these rules for CLI flags:\n\n\n\n\nThe root level's first character is lower-cased with the rest of the root\n    level's text left unaltered.\n\n\nThe remaining levels' first characters are all upper-cased with the the\n    remaining text of that level left unaltered.\n\n\nAll levels are then concatenated together.\n\n\n\n\nThe following example builds on the previous. In this case we have added logging\ndirectives to the client instance and reference how their transformation in\nthe table below the example.\n\n\n  libstorage:\n    host: tcp://192.168.0.20:7979\n    logging:\n      level: warn\n      stdout:\n      stderr:\n      httpRequests: false\n      httpResponses: false\n\n\n\n\nThe following table illustrates the transformations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty Name\n\n\nEnvironment Variable\n\n\nCLI Flag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.host\n\n\nLIBSTORAGE_HOST\n\n\n--libstorageHost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.logging.level\n\n\nLIBSTORAGE_LOGGING_LEVEL\n\n\n--libstorageLoggingLevel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.logging.stdout\n\n\nLIBSTORAGE_LOGGING_STDOUT\n\n\n--libstorageLoggingStdout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.logging.stderr\n\n\nLIBSTORAGE_LOGGING_STDERR\n\n\n--libstorageLoggingStderr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.logging.httpRequests\n\n\nLIBSTORAGE_LOGGING_HTTPREQUESTS\n\n\n--libstorageLoggingHttpRequests\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.logging.httpResponses\n\n\nLIBSTORAGE_LOGGING_HTTPRESPONSES\n\n\n--libstorageLoggingHttpResponses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInherited Properties\n\n\nReferring to the section on defining\n\nMultiple Services\n, there is also another way\nto define the TLS settings for the external TCP endpoint. The same configuration\ncan be rewritten and simplified in the process:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  integration:\n    volume:\n      operations:\n        create:\n          default:\n            size: 1 # GB\n  server:\n    virtualbox:\n      endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n      tls:            false\n      controllerName: SATA\n    services:\n      virtualbox-00:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          volumePath: $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes-00\n      virtualbox-01:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          volumePath: $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes-01\n\n\n\n\nThe above example may look different than the previous one, but it's actually\nthe same with a minor tweak in order to simplify configuration.\n\n\nWhile there are still two VirtualBox services defined, \nvirtualbox-00\n and\n\nvirtualbox-01\n, neither service contains configuration information about the\nVirtualBox driver other than the \nvolumePath\n property. This is because the\nchange affected above is to take advantage of inherited properties.\n\n\nWhen a property is omitted, \nlibStorage\n traverses the configuration instance\nupwards, checking certain, predefined levels known as \"scopes\" to see if the\nproperty value exists there. All configured services represent a valid\nconfiguration scope as does \nlibstorage.server\n.\n\n\nThus when the VirtualBox driver is initialized and it checks for its properties,\nwhile the driver may only find the \nvolumePath\n property defined under the\nconfigured service scope, the property access attempt travels up the\nconfiguration stack until it hits the \nlibstorage.server\n scope where the\nremainder of the VirtualBox driver's properties \nare\n defined.\n\n\nOverriding Inherited Properties\n\n\nIt's also possible to override inherited properties as is demonstrated in the\n\nLogging configuration example\n above:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  logging:\n    level: warn\n  integration:\n    volume:\n      operations:\n        create:\n          default:\n            size: 1 # GB\n  server:\n    logging:\n      level: info\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\nNote that while the log level is defined at the root of the config, it's also\ndefined at \nlibstorage.server.logging.level\n. The latter value of \ninfo\n\noverrides the former value of \nwarn\n. Also please remember that even had the\nlatter, server-specific value of \ninfo\n not been defined, an attempt by to\naccess the log level by the server would be perfectly valid since the attempt\nwould traverse up the configuration data until it found the log level defined\nat the root of the configuration.\n\n\nLogging Configuration\n\n\nThe \nlibStorage\n log level determines the level of verbosity emitted by the\ninternal logger. The default level is \nwarn\n, but there are three other levels\nas well:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog Level\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerror\n\n\nLog only errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwarn\n\n\nLog errors and anything out of place\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninfo\n\n\nLog errors, warnings, and workflow messages\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndebug\n\n\nLog everything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTasks Configuration\n\n\nAll operations received by the libStorage API are immediately enqueued into a\nTask Service in order to divorce the business objective from the scope of the\nHTTP request that delivered it. If a task completes before the HTTP request\ntimes out, the result of the task is written to the HTTP response and sent to\nthe client. However, if the operation is long-lived and continues to execute\nafter the original HTTP request has timed out, the goroutine running the\noperation will finish regardless.\n\n\nIn the case of such a timeout event, the client receives an HTTP status 408 -\nRequest Timeout. The HTTP response body also includes the task ID which can\nbe used to monitor the state of the remote call. The following resource URI can\nbe used to retrieve information about a task:\n\n\nGET /tasks/${taskID}\n\n\n\n\nFor systems that experience heavy loads the task system can also be a source of\npotential resource issues. Because tasks are kept indefinitely at this point in\ntime, too many tasks over a long period of time can result in a massive memory\nconsumption, with reports of up to 50GB and more.\n\n\nThat's why the configuration property \nlibstorage.server.tasks.logTimeout\n is\navailable to adjust how long a task is logged before it is removed from memory.\nThe default value is \n0\n -- that is, do not log the task in memory at all.\n\n\nWhile this is in contradiction to the task retrieval example above --\nobviously a task cannot be retrieved if it is not retained -- testing and\nbenchmarks have shown it is too dangerous to enable task retention by default.\nInstead tasks are removed immediately upon completion.\n\n\nThe follow configuration example illustrates a libStorage server that keeps\ntasks logged for 10 minutes before purging them from memory:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    tasks:\n      logTimeout: 10m\n\n\n\n\nThe \nlibstorage.server.tasks.logTimeout\n property can be set to any value that\nis parseable by the Golang\n\ntime.ParseDuration\n function. For\nexample, \n1000ms\n, \n10s\n, \n5m\n, and \n1h\n are all valid values.\n\n\nDriver Configuration\n\n\nThere are three types of drivers:\n\n\n\n\nOS Drivers\n\n\nStorage Drivers\n\n\nIntegration Drivers\n\n\n\n\nOS Drivers\n\n\nOperating system (OS) drivers enable \nlibStorage\n to manage storage on\nthe underlying OS. Currently the following OS drivers are supported:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriver\n\n\nDriver Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nlinux\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe OS driver \nlinux\n is automatically activated when \nlibStorage\n is running on\nthe Linux OS.\n\n\nStorage Drivers\n\n\nStorage drivers enable \nlibStorage\n to communicate with direct-attached or\nremote storage systems. Currently the following storage drivers are supported:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriver\n\n\nDriver Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDell EMC Isilon\n\n\nisilon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDell EMC ScaleIO\n\n\nscaleio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtualBox\n\n\nvirtualbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS EBS\n\n\nebs, ec2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS EFS\n\n\nefs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS S3FS\n\n\ns3fs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCeph RBD\n\n\nrbd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGCE PD\n\n\ngcepd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzure UD\n\n\nazureud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nlibstorage.server.libstorage.storage.driver\n property can be used to\nactivate a storage drivers. That is not a typo; the \nlibstorage\n key is repeated\nbeneath \nlibstorage.server\n. This is because configuration property paths are\nabsolute, and when nested under an architectural component, such as\n\nlibstorage.server\n, the entire key path must be replicated.\n\n\nThat said, and this may seem to contradict the last point, the storage driver\nproperty is valid \nonly\n on the server. Well, not really. Internally the\n\nlibStorage\n client uses the same configuration property to denote its own\nstorage driver. This internal storage driver is actually how the \nlibStorage\n\nclient communicates with the \nlibStorage\n server.\n\n\nIntegration Drivers\n\n\nIntegration drivers enable \nlibStorage\n to integrate with schedulers and other\nstorage consumers, such as \nDocker\n or \nMesos\n. Currently the following\nintegration drivers are supported:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriver\n\n\nDriver Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nlinux\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe integration driver \nlinux\n provides necessary functionality to enable\nmost consuming platforms to work with storage volumes.\n\n\nVolume Configuration\n\n\nThis section describes various global configuration options related to an\nintegration driver's volume operations, such as mounting and unmounting volumes.\n\n\nVolume Properties\n\n\nThe properties listed below are the global properties valid for an integration\ndriver's volume-related properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparameter\n\n\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.integration.volume.operations.mount.preempt\n\n\nForcefully take control of volumes when requested\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.integration.volume.operations.mount.path\n\n\nThe default host path for mounting volumes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.integration.volume.operations.mount.rootPath\n\n\nThe path within the volume to return to the integrator (ex. \n/data\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.integration.volume.operations.create.disable\n\n\nDisable the ability for a volume to be created\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.integration.volume.operations.remove.disable\n\n\nDisable the ability for a volume to be removed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe properties in the next table are the configurable parameters that affect\nthe default values for volume creation requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparameter\n\n\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.integration.volume.operations.create.default.size\n\n\nSize in GB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.integration.volume.operations.create.default.iops\n\n\nIOPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.integration.volume.operations.create.default.type\n\n\nType of Volume or Storage Pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.integration.volume.operations.create.default.fsType\n\n\nType of filesystem for new volumes (ext4/xfs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibstorage.integration.volume.operations.create.default.availabilityZone\n\n\nExtensible parameter per storage driver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable Create\n\n\nThe disable create feature enables you to disallow any volume creation activity.\nAny requests will be returned in a successful manner, but the create will not\nget passed to the backend storage platform.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  integration:\n    volume:\n      operations:\n        create:\n          disable: true\n\n\n\n\nDisable Remove\n\n\nThe disable remove feature enables you to disallow any volume removal activity.\nAny requests will be returned in a successful manner, but the remove will not\nget passed to the backend storage platform.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  integration:\n    volume:\n      operations:\n        remove:\n          disable: true\n\n\n\n\nPreemption\n\n\nThere is a capability to preemptively detach any existing attachments to other\ninstances before attempting a mount.

The operation is considered\nequivalent to a power off of the existing instance for the device.\n\n\nExample configuration file follows:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  integration:\n    volume:\n      operations:\n        mount:\n          preempt: true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriver\n\n\nSupported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDell EMC Isilon\n\n\nNot yet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDell EMC ScaleIO\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtualBox\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS EBS\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS EFS\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS S3FS\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCeph RBD\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGCE PD\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzure UD\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnore Used Count\n\n\nBy default accounting takes place during operations that are performed\non \nMount\n, \nUnmount\n, and other operations.  This only has impact when running\nas a service through the HTTP/JSON interface since the counts are persisted\nin memory.  The purpose of respecting the \nUsed Count\n is to ensure that a\nvolume is not unmounted until the unmount requests have equaled the mount\nrequests.  \n\n\nIn the \nDocker\n use case if there are multiple containers sharing a volume\non the same host, the the volume will not be unmounted until the last container\nis stopped.  \n\n\nThe following setting should only be used if you wish to \ndisable\n this\nfunctionality.  This would make sense if the accounting is being done from\nhigher layers and all unmount operations should proceed without control.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  integration:\n    volume:\n      operations:\n        unmount:\n          ignoreUsedCount: true\n\n\n\n\nCurrently a reset of the service will cause the counts to be reset.  This\nwill cause issues if \nmultiple containers\n are sharing a volume.  If you are\nsharing volumes, it is recommended that you reset the service along with the\naccompanying container runtime (if this setting is false) to ensure they are\nsynchronized.  \n\n\nVolume Path Cache\n\n\nIn order to optimize \nPath\n requests, the paths of actively mounted volumes\nreturned as the result of a \nList\n request are cached. Subsequent \nPath\n\nrequests for unmounted volumes will not dirty the cache. Only once a volume\nhas been mounted will the cache be marked dirty and the volume's path retrieved\nand cached once more.\n\n\nThe following configuration example illustrates the two path cache properties:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  integration:\n    volume:\n      operations:\n        path:\n          cache:\n            enabled: true\n            async:   true\n\n\n\n\nVolume path caching is enabled and asynchronous by default, so it's possible to\nentirely omit the above configuration excerpt from a production deployment, and\nthe system will still use asynchronous caching. Setting the \nasync\n property to\n\nfalse\n simply means that the initial population of the cache will be handled\nsynchronously, slowing down the program's startup time.\n\n\nVolume Root Path\n\n\nWhen volumes are mounted there can be an additional path that is specified to\nbe created and passed as the valid mount point.  This is required for certain\napplications that do not want to place data from the root of a mount point.\n\n\nThe default is the \n/data\n path.  If a value is set by\n\nlinux.integration.volume.operations.mount.rootPath\n, then the default will be\noverwritten.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  integration:\n    volume:\n      operations:\n        mount:\n          rootPath: /data\n\n\n\n\nREST Configuration\n\n\nThis section reviews advanced HTTP REST configuration options:\n\n\nParse POST Options\n\n\nNormally an incoming POST request with an \nopts\n field does not copy the\nkey/value pairs in the \nopts\n map into the fields that match the request's\nschema. For example, take a look at the following request:\n\n\n{\n    \nname\n: \nnewVolume\n,\n    \niops\n: 0,\n    \nsize\n: 5,\n    \ntype\n: \nblock\n,\n    \nopts\n: {\n        \nencrypted\n: true,\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe above request is used for creating a new volume, and it appears that the\nintention is to create the volume as encrypted. However, the \nencrypted\n field\nis part of the free-form \nopts\n piece of the request. The \nopts\n map is for\ndata that is not yet part of the official libStorage API and schema. Certain\ndrivers may parse data out of the \nopts\n field, but it \nis\n driver specific.\nThe libStorage server does not normally attempt to parse this field's keys\nand match it to the request's fields. A proper request would look like this:\n\n\n{\n    \nname\n:      \nnewVolume\n,\n    \niops\n:      0,\n    \nsize\n:      5,\n    \ntype\n:      \nblock\n,\n    \nencrypted\n: true,\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make things a little easier on clients, a server can be configured\nto treat the first JSON request as equal to the second. This feature is disabled\nby default due to the possibility of side-effects. For example, a value in the\n\nopts\n map could unintentionally overwrite the intended value if both keys are\nthe same.\n\n\nTo enable this feature, the libStorage server's configuration should set the\n\nlibstorage.server.parseRequestOpts\n property to true. An example YAML snippet\nwith this property enabled resembles the following:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    parseRequestOpts: true\n\n\n\n\nWith the above property set to \ntrue\n, values in a request's \nopts\n map will be\ncopied to the corresponding key in the request proper.",

However, it is possible\nto configure many services at the same time in order to provide access to\nmultiple storage drivers of different types, or even different configurations\nof the same driver.  The following example demonstrates how to configure three  libStorage  services:     service  driver      virtualbox-00  virtualbox    virtualbox-01  virtualbox    scaleio  scaleio     Notice how the  virtualbox-01  service includes an added  integration  section.\nThe integration definition refers to the integration interface and parameters\nspecific to incoming requests through this layer. In this case we defined libstorage.server.services.virtualbox-01  with the integration.volume.operations.create.default.size  parameter set. This enables all\ncreate requests that come in through  virtualbox-01  to have a default size of\n1GB.

Between the three services above, clearly one major difference is that two\nservices host one driver, VirtualBox, and the third service hosts ScaleIO.\nHowever, why two services for one driver, in this case, VirtualBox?

Any client can take advantage of\nAmazon's S3 buckets.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nAWS account\n\n\nThe \ns3fs\n FUSE command must be\npresent on client nodes.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe following is an example with all possible fields configured.  For a running\nexample see the \nExamples\n section.\n\n\nServer-Side Configuration\n\n\ns3fs:\n  region:           us-east-1\n  accessKey:        XXXXXXXXXX\n  secretKey:        XXXXXXXXXX\n  disablePathStyle: false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \naccessKey\n and \nsecretKey\n configuration parameters are optional and\nshould be used when explicit AWS credentials configuration needs to be provided.\nThe S3FS driver uses the official Golang AWS SDK library and supports all other\nways of  providing access credentials, like environment variables or instance\nprofile IAM permissions.\n\n\nregion\n represents AWS region where S3FS buckets should be provisioned.\nPlease see the official AWS documentation for list of\n\nsupported regions\n.\n\n\nThe \ndisablePathStyle\n property disables the use of the path style for\nbucket endpoints. The path style is more stable with regards to regions\nthan bucket URI FQDNs, but the path style is also less performant.\n\n\n\n\nClient-Side Configuration\n\n\ns3fs:\n  cmd:            s3fs\n  options:\n  - XXXX\n  - XXXX\n  accessKey:      XXXXXXXXXX\n  secretKey:      XXXXXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ncmd\n property defaults simply to \ns3fs\n with the assumption that the\n\ns3fs\n binary will be in the path. This value can also be the absolute path\nto the \ns3fs\n binary.\n\n\noptions\n is a list of options to pass to the \ns3fs\n command. Please see the\n\nofficial\n\ndocumentation for a full list of CLI options. The \n-o\n prefix should not be\nprovided in the configuration file.\n\n\nThe credential properties can be defined on the client via the configuration\nfile and will be supplied to the \ns3fs\n process via environment variables.\nHowever, the \ns3fs\n command will also look in all the\n\nusual places\n\nfor the credentials if they're not in this file.\n\n\n\n\nFor information on the equivalent environment variable and CLI flag names\nplease see the section on how non top-level configuration properties are\n\ntransformed\n.\n\n\nRuntime Behavior\n\n\nThe AWS S3FS storage driver can create new buckets as well as remove existing\nones. Buckets are mounted to clients as filesystems using the\n\ns3fs\n FUSE command. For clients\nto correctly mount and unmount S3 buckets the \ns3fs\n command should be in\nthe path of the executor or configured via the \ns3fs.cmd\n property in the\nclient-side REX-Ray configuration file.\n\n\nThe client must also have access to the AWS credentials used for mounting and\nunmounting S3 buckets. These credentials can be stored in the client-side\nREX-Ray configuration file or via\n\nany means avaialble\n\nto the \ns3fs\n command.\n\n\nActivating the Driver\n\n\nTo activate the AWS S3FS driver please follow the instructions for\n\nactivating storage drivers\n,\nusing \ns3fs\n as the driver name.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nBelow is a working \nconfig.yml\n file that works with AWS S3FS.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    services:\n      s3fs:\n        driver: s3fs\n        s3fs:\n          accessKey:      XXXXXXXXXX\n          secretKey:      XXXXXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\nCeph\n\n\nlibStorage includes support for the following Ceph storage technologies.\n\n\n\n\nRADOS Block Device\n\n\nThe Ceph RBD driver registers a driver named \nrbd\n with the \nlibStorage\n driver\nmanager and is used to connect and mount RADOS Block Devices from a Ceph\ncluster.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nThe \nceph\n and \nrbd\n binary executables must be installed on the host\n\n\nThe \nrbd\n kernel module must be installed\n\n\nA \nceph.conf\n file must be present in its default location\n  (\n/etc/ceph/ceph.conf\n)\n\n\nThe ceph \nadmin\n key must be present in \n/etc/ceph/\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe following is an example with all possible fields configured. For a running\nexample see the \nExamples\n section.\n\n\nrbd:\n  defaultPool: rbd\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Notes\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndefaultPool\n parameter is optional, and defaults to \"rbd\". When set, all\n  volume requests that do not reference a specific pool will use the\n  \ndefaultPool\n value as the destination storage pool.\n\n\n\n\nRuntime behavior\n\n\nThe Ceph RBD driver only works when the client and server are on the same node.\nThere is no way for a centralized \nlibStorage\n server to attach volumes to\nclients, therefore the \nlibStorage\n server must be running on each node that\nwishes to mount RBD volumes.\n\n\nThe RBD driver uses the format of \npool\n.\nname\n for the volume ID. This allows\nfor the use of multiple pools by the driver. During a volume create, if the\nvolume ID is given as \npool\n.\nname\n, a volume named \nname\n will be created in\nthe \npool\n storage pool. If no pool is referenced, the \ndefaultPool\n will be\nused.\n\n\nBoth \npool\n and \nname\n may only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores,\nand dashes.\n\n\nWhen querying volumes, the driver will return all RBDs present in all pools in\nthe cluster, prefixing each volume with the appropriate \npool\n.\n value.\n\n\nAll RBD creates are done using the default 4MB object size, and using the\n\"layering\" feature bit to ensure greatest compatibility with the kernel clients.\n\n\nActivating the Driver\n\n\nTo activate the Ceph RBD driver please follow the instructions for\n\nactivating storage drivers\n, using \nrbd\n as the\ndriver name.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that \nceph\n and \nrbd\n commands work without extra parameters for\n  ID, key, and monitors. All configuration must come from \nceph.conf\n.\n\n\nCheck status of the ceph cluster with \nceph -s\n command.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nBelow is a full \nconfig.yml\n that works with RBD\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    services:\n      rbd:\n        driver: rbd\n        rbd:\n          defaultPool: rbd\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot and copy functionality is not yet implemented\n\n\nlibStorage Server must be running on each host to mount/attach RBD volumes\n\n\nThere is not yet options for using non-admin cephx keys or changing RBD create\n  features\n\n\nVolume pre-emption is not supported. Ceph does not provide a method to\n  forcefully detach a volume from a remote host -- only a host can attach and\n  detach volumes from itself.\n\n\nRBD advisory locks are not yet in use. A volume is returned as \"unavailable\"\n  if it has a watcher other than the requesting client. Until advisory locks are\n  in place, it may be possible for a client to attach a volume that is already\n  attached to another node. Mounting and writing to such a volume could lead to\n  data corruption.\n\n\n\n\nDell EMC\n\n\nlibStorage includes support for several Dell EMC storage platforms.\n\n\n\n\nIsilon\n\n\nThe Isilon driver registers a storage driver named \nisilon\n with the\nlibStorage service registry and is used to connect and manage Isilon NAS\nstorage. The driver creates logical volumes in directories on the Isilon\ncluster. Volumes are exported via NFS and restricted to a single client at a\ntime. Quotas can also be used to ensure that a volume directory doesn't exceed\na specified size.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe following is an example configuration of the Isilon driver.\n\n\nisilon:\n  endpoint: https://endpoint:8080\n  insecure: true\n  username: username\n  group: groupname\n  password: password\n  volumePath: /libstorage\n  nfsHost: nfsHost\n  dataSubnet: subnet\n  quotas: true\n\n\n\n\nFor information on the equivalent environment variable and CLI flag names\nplease see the section on how configuration properties are\n\ntransformed\n.\n\n\nExtra Parameters\n\n\nThe following items are configurable specific to this driver.\n\n\n\n\nvolumePath\n represents the location under \n/ifs/volumes\n to allow volumes to\n   be created and removed.\n\n\nnfsHost\n is the configurable NFS server hostname or IP (often a\n   SmartConnect name) used when mounting exports\n\n\ndataSubnet\n is the subnet the REX-Ray driver is running on. This is used\n   for the NFS export host ACLs.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Parameters\n\n\nThe following items are not required, but available to this driver.\n\n\n\n\ninsecure\n defaults to \nfalse\n.\n\n\ngroup\n defaults to the group of the user specified in the configuration.\n   Only use this option if you need volumes to be created with a different\n   group.\n\n\nvolumePath\n defaults to \"\". This will have all new volumes created directly\n   under \n/ifs/volumes\n.\n\n\nquotas\n defaults to \nfalse\n. Set to \ntrue\n if you have a SmartQuotas\n   license enabled.\n\n\n\n\nActivating the Driver\n\n\nTo activate the Isilon driver please follow the instructions for\n\nactivating storage drivers\n,\nusing \nisilon\n as the driver name.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nBelow is a full \nconfig.yml\n file that works with Isilon.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    services:\n      isilon:\n        driver: isilon\n        isilon:\n          endpoint: https://endpoint:8080\n          insecure: true\n          username: username\n          password: password\n          volumePath: /libstorage\n          nfsHost: nfsHost\n          dataSubnet: subnet\n          quotas: true\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nIt is expected that the \nvolumePath\n exists already within the Isilon system.\nThis example would reflect a directory create under \n/ifs/volumes/libstorage\n\nfor created volumes. It is not necessary to export this volume. The \ndataSubnet\n\nparameter is required so the Isilon driver can restrict access to attached\nvolumes to the host that REX-Ray is running on.\n\n\nIf \nquotas\n are enabled, a SmartQuotas license must also be enabled on the\nIsilon cluster for the capacity size functionality of \nlibStorage\n to work.\n\n\nA SnapshotIQ license must be enabled on the Isilon cluster for the snapshot\nfunctionality of \nlibStorage\n to work.\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\nThe Isilon driver is not without its caveats:\n\n\n\n\nThe account used to access the Isilon cluster must be in a role with the\n  following privileges:\n\n\nNamespace Access (ISI_PRIV_NS_IFS_ACCESS)\n\n\nPlatform API (ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_PAPI)\n\n\nNFS (ISI_PRIV_NFS)\n\n\nRestore (ISI_PRIV_IFS_RESTORE)\n\n\nQuota (ISI_PRIV_QUOTA)          (if \nquotas\n are enabled)\n\n\nSnapshot (ISI_PRIV_SNAPSHOT)    (if snapshots are used)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaleIO\n\n\nThe ScaleIO driver registers a storage driver named \nscaleio\n with the\nlibStorage service registry and is used to connect and manage ScaleIO storage.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nThe ScaleIO \nREST Gateway\n is required for the driver to function.\n\n\nThe \nlibStorage\n client or application that embeds the \nlibStorage\n client\n   must reside on a host that has the SDC client installed. The command\n   \n/opt/emc/scaleio/sdc/bin/drv_cfg --query_guid\n should be executable and\n   should return the local SDC GUID.\n\n\nThe \nofficial\n\n   Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required. During testing, use of the\n   Open Java Development Kit (JDK) resulted in unexpected errors.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe following is an example with all possible fields configured.  For a running\nexample see the \nExamples\n section.\n\n\nscaleio:\n  endpoint:             https://host_ip/api\n  apiVersion:           \n2.0\n\n  insecure:             false\n  useCerts:             true\n  userName:             admin\n  password:             mypassword\n  systemID:             0\n  systemName:           sysv\n  protectionDomainID:   0\n  protectionDomainName: corp\n  storagePoolID:        0\n  storagePoolName:      gold\n  thinOrThick:          ThinProvisioned\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Notes\n\n\n\n\nThe \napiVersion\n can optionally be set here to force certain API behavior.\nThe default is to retrieve the endpoint API, and pass this version during calls.\n\n\ninsecure\n should be set to \ntrue\n if you have not loaded the SSL\ncertificates on the host.  A successful wget or curl should be possible without\nSSL errors to the API \nendpoint\n in this case.\n\n\nuseCerts\n should only be set if you want to leverage the internal SSL\ncertificates.  This would be useful if you are deploying the REX-Ray binary\non a host that does not have any certificates installed.\n\n\nsystemID\n takes priority over \nsystemName\n.\n\n\nprotectionDomainID\n takes priority over \nprotectionDomainName\n.\n\n\nstoragePoolID\n takes priority over \nstoragePoolName\n.\n\n\nthinkOrThick\n determines whether to provision as the default\n\nThinProvisioned\n, or \nThickProvisioned\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor information on the equivalent environment variable and CLI flag names\nplease see the section on how non top-level configuration properties are\n\ntransformed\n.\n\n\nRuntime Behavior\n\n\nThe \nstorageType\n field that is configured per volume is considered the\nScaleIO Storage Pool.  This can be configured by default with the \nstoragePool\n\nsetting.  It is important that you create unique names for your Storage Pools\non the same ScaleIO platform.  Otherwise, when specifying \nstorageType\n it\nmay choose at random which \nprotectionDomain\n the pool comes from.\n\n\nThe \navailabilityZone\n field represents the ScaleIO Protection Domain.\n\n\nConfiguring the Gateway\n\n\n\n\nInstall the \nEMC-ScaleIO-gateway\n package.\n\n\nEdit the\n\n/opt/emc/scaleio/gateway/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/gatewayUser.properties\n\nfile and append the proper MDM IP addresses to the following \nmdm.ip.addresses=\n\nparameter.\n\n\nBy default the password is the same as your administrative MDM password.\n\n\nStart the gateway \nservice scaleio-gateway start\n.\n\n\nWith 1.32 we have noticed a restart of the gateway may be necessary as well\nafter an initial install with \nservice scaleio-gateway restart\n.\n\n\n\n\nActivating the Driver\n\n\nTo activate the ScaleIO driver please follow the instructions for\n\nactivating storage drivers\n,\nusing \nscaleio\n as the driver name.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nVerify your parameters for \nsystem\n, \nprotectionDomain\n, and\n\nstoragePool\n are correct.\n\n\nVerify that have the ScaleIO SDC service installed with\n\nrpm -qa EMC-ScaleIO-sdc\n\n\nVerify that the following command returns the local SDC GUID\n\n/opt/emc/scaleio/sdc/bin/drv_cfg --query_guid\n.\n\n\nEnsure that you are able to open a TCP connection to the gateway with the\naddress that you will be supplying below in the \ngateway_ip\n parameter.  For\nexample \ntelnet gateway_ip 443\n should open a successful connection.  Removing\nthe \nEMC-ScaleIO-gateway\n package and reinstalling can force re-creation of\nself-signed certs which may help resolve gateway problems.  Also try restarting\nthe gateway with \nservice scaleio-gateway restart\n.\n\n\nEnsure that you have the correct authentication credentials for the gateway.\nThis can be done with a curl login. You should receive an authentication\ntoken in return.\n\ncurl --insecure --user admin:XScaleio123 https://gw_ip:443/api/login\n\n\nPlease review the gateway log at\n\n/opt/emc/scaleio/gateway/logs/catalina.out\n for errors.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nBelow is a full \nconfig.yml\n file that works with ScaleIO.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    services:\n      scaleio:\n        driver: scaleio\n        scaleio:\n          endpoint: https://gateway_ip/api\n          insecure: true\n          userName: username\n          password: password\n          systemName: tenantName\n          protectionDomainName: protectionDomainName\n          storagePoolName: storagePoolName\n\n\n\n\nDigitalOcean\n\n\nThanks to the efforts of our tremendous community, libStorage also has built-in\nsupport for DigitalOcean!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO Block Storage\n\n\nThe DigitalOcean Block Storage (DOBS) driver registers a driver named \ndobs\n\nwith the libStorage service registry and is used to attach and mount\nDigitalOcean block storage devices to DigitalOcean instances.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nThe DigitalOcean block storage driver has the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nValid DigitalOcean account\n\n\nValid DigitalOcean \naccess token\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe following example illustrates a minimal configuration for the DigitalOcean\nblock storage driver:\n\n\ndobs:\n  token:  123456\n  region: nyc1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe standard environment variable for the DigitalOcean access token is\n\nDIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN\n. However, the environment variable mapped to\nthis driver's \ndobs.token\n property is \nDOBS_TOKEN\n. This choice was made\nto ensure that the driver must be explicitly configured for access instead\nof detecting a default token that may not be intended for the driver.\n\n\n\n\nFittedCloud\n\n\nAnother example of the great community shared by the libStorage project, the\ntalented people at FittedCloud have provided a driver for their EBS optimizer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEBS Optimizer\n\n\nThe FittedCloud EBS Optimizer driver registers a storage driver named\n\nfittedcloud\n with the libStorage service registry and provides the ability to\nconnect and manage thin-provisioned EBS volumes for EC2 instances.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis version of the FittedCloud driver only supports configurations where\nclient and server are on the same host.  The libStorage server must be\nrunning on each node along side with the FittedCloud Agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis version of the FittedCloud driver does not support co-existing with the\nebs driver on the same host. As a result it also doesn't support optimizing\nexisting EBS volumes.   See the \nExamples\n section\nbelow for a running example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe FittedCloud driver does not yet support snapshots or tags.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nThis driver has the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nAWS account\n\n\nVPC - EBS can be accessed within VPC\n\n\nAWS Credentials\n\n\nFittedCloud Agent software\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nBefore starting, please make sure to register as a user by visiting the\nFittedCloud \ncustomer website\n.\nOnce an account is activated it will be assigned a user ID, which can be found\non the Settings page after logging into the web site.\n\n\nThe following commands will download and install the latest FittedCloud Agent\nsoftware. The flags \n-o S -m\n enable new thin volumes to be created via the\ndocker command instead of optimizing existing EBS volumes.\nPlease replace the \nUser ID\n with a FittedCloud user ID.\n\n\n$ curl -skSL 'https://customer.fittedcloud.com/downloadsoftware?ver=latest' \\\n  -o fcagent.run\n$ sudo bash ./fcagent.run -- -o S -m -d \nUser ID\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to FittedCloud\n\nwebsite\n for more details.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe following is an example with all possible fields configured.  For a running\nexample see the \nExamples\n section.\n\n\nebs:\n  accessKey:      XXXXXXXXXX\n  secretKey:      XXXXXXXXXX\n  kmsKeyID:       abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Notes\n\n\n\n\nFittedCloud driver shares the ebs driver's configuration\nparameters.\n\n\nThe \naccessKey\n and \nsecretKey\n configuration parameters are optional and\nshould be used when explicit AWS credentials configuration needs to be provided.\nFittedCloud driver uses official golang AWS SDK library and supports all other\nways of providing access credentials, like environment variables or instance\nprofile IAM permissions.\n\n\nIf the \nkmsKeyID\n field is specified it will be used as the encryption key for\nall volumes that are created with a truthy encryption request field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThe following example illustrates how to configured the FittedCloud driver:\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  service:    fittedcloud\nebs:\n  accessKey:  XXXXXXXXXX\n  secretKey:  XXXXXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information on configuring the FittedCloud driver may be found\nat \nthis\n location.\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\nlibStorage ships with support for Google Compute Engine (GCE) as well.\n\n\n\n\nGCE Persistent Disk\n\n\nThe Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk (GCEPD) driver registers a driver\nnamed \ngcepd\n with the libStorage service registry and is used to connect and\nmount Google Compute Engine (GCE) persistent disks with GCE machine instances.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nGCE account\n\n\nThe libStorage server must be running on a GCE instance created with a Service\n  Account with appropriate permissions, or a Service Account credentials file\n  in JSON format must be supplied. If not using the Compute Engine default\n  Service Account with the Cloud Platform/\"all cloud APIs\" scope, create a new\n  Service Account via the \nIAM Portal\n.\n  This Service Account requires the \nCompute Engine/Instance Admin\n,\n  \nCompute Engine/Storage Admin\n, and \nProject/Service Account Actor\n roles.\n  Then create/download a new private key in JSON format. see\n  \ncreating a service account\n\n  for details. The libStorage service must be restarted in order for permissions\n  changes on a service account to take effect.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe following is an example with all possible fields configured. For a running\nexample see the \nExamples\n section.\n\n\ngcepd:\n  keyfile: /etc/gcekey.json\n  zone: us-west1-b\n  defaultDiskType: pd-ssd\n  tag: rexray\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Notes\n\n\n\n\nThe \nkeyfile\n parameter is optional. It specifies a path on disk to a file\n  containing the JSON-encoded Service Account credentials. This file can be\n  downloaded from the GCE web portal. If \nkeyfile\n is specified, the GCE\n  instance's service account is not considered, and is not necessary. If\n  \nkeyfile\n is \nnot\n specified, the application will try to lookup\n  \napplication default credentials\n.\n  This has the effect of looking for credentials in the priority described\n  \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe \nzone\n parameter is optional, and configures the driver to \nonly\n allow\n  access to the given zone. Creating and listing disks from other zones will be\n  denied. If a zone is not specified, the zone from the client Instance ID will\n  be used when creating new disks.\n\n\nThe \ndefaultDiskType\n parameter is optional and specifies what type of disk\n  to create, either \npd-standard\n or \npd-ssd\n. When not specified, the default\n  is \npd-ssd\n.\n\n\nThe \ntag\n parameter is optional, and causes the driver to create or return\n  disks that have a matching tag. The tag is implemented by using the GCE\n  label functionality available in the beta API. The value of the \ntag\n\n  parameter is used as the value for a label with the key \nlibstoragetag\n.\n  Use of this parameter is encouraged, as the driver will only return volumes\n  that have been created by the driver, which is most useful to eliminate\n  listing the boot disks of every GCE disk in your project/zone. If you wsih to\n  \"expose\" previously created disks to the \nGCEPD\n driver, you can edit the\n  labels on the existing disk to have a key of \nlibstoragetag\n and a value\n  matching that given in \ntag\n.\n\n\n\n\nRuntime behavior\n\n\n\n\nThe GCEPD driver enforces the GCE requirements for disk sizing and naming.\n  Disks must be created with a minimum size of 10GB. Disk names must adhere to\n  the regular expression of \n[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?\n, which means the first\n  character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a\n  dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a\n  dash.\n\n\nIf the \nzone\n parameter is not specified in the driver configuration, and a\n  request is received to list all volumes that does not specify a zone in the\n  InstanceID header, volumes from all zones will be returned.\n\n\nBy default, all disks will be created with type \npd-ssd\n, which creates an SSD\n  based disk. If you wish to create disks that are not SSD-based, change the\n  default via the driver config, or the type can be changed at creation time by\n  using the \nType\n field of the create request.\n\n\n\n\nActivating the Driver\n\n\nTo activate the GCEPD driver please follow the instructions for\n\nactivating storage drivers\n, using \ngcepd\n as the\ndriver name.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the JSON credentials file as specified in the \nkeyfile\n\n  configuration parameter is present and accessible, or that you are running in\n  a GCE instance created with a Service Account attached. Whether using a\n  \nkeyfile\n or the Service Account associated with the GCE instance, the Service\n  Account must have the appropriate permissions as described in\n  \nConfiguration Notes\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nBelow is a full \nconfig.yml\n that works with GCE\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    services:\n      gcepd:\n        driver: gcepd\n        gcepd:\n          keyfile: /etc/gcekey.json\n          tag: rexray\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot and copy functionality is not yet implemented\n\n\nMost GCE instances can have up to 64 TB of total persistent disk space\n  attached. Shared-core machine types or custom machine types with less than\n  3.75 GB of memory are limited to 3 TB of total persistent disk space. Total\n  persistent disk space for an instance includes the size of the root persistent\n  disk. You can attach up to 16 independent persistent disks to most instances,\n  but instances with shared-core machine types or custom machine types with less\n  than 3.75 GB of memory are limited to a maximum of 4 persistent disks,\n  including the root persistent disk. See\n  \nGCE Disks\n docs for more\n  details.\n\n\nIf running libStorage server in a mode where volume mounts will not be\n  performed on the same host where libStorage server is running, it should be\n  possible to use a Service Account without the \nService Account Actor\n role, but\n  this has not been tested. Note that if persistent disk mounts are to be\n  performed on \nany\n GCE instances that have a Service Account associated with\n  the, the \nService Account Actor\n role is required.\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\nMicrosoft Azure support is included with libStorage as well.\n\n\n\n\nAzure Unmanaged Disk\n\n\nThe Microsoft Azure Unmanaged Disk (Azure UD) driver registers a driver\nnamed \nazureud\n with the libStorage service registry and is used to connect and\nmount Azure unmanaged disks from Azure page blob storage with Azure virtual\nmachines.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nAn Azure account\n\n\nAn Azure subscription\n\n\nAn Azure storage account\n\n\nAn Azure resource group\n\n\nAny virtual machine where disks are going to be attached must have the\n  \nlsscsi\n utility installed. You can install this with \nyum install lsscsi\n on\n  Red Hat based distributions, or with \napt-get install lsscsi\n on Debian based\n  distributions.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe following is an example with all possible fields configured. For a running\nexample see the \nExamples\n section.\n\n\nazureud:\n  subscriptionID: abcdef01-2345-6789-abcd-ef0123456789\n  resourceGroup: testgroup\n  tenantID: usernamehotmail.onmicrosoft.com\n  storageAccount: username\n  storageAccessKey: XXXXXXXX\n  clientID: 123def01-2345-6789-abcd-ef0123456789\n  clientSecret: XXXXXXXX\n  certPath:\n  container: vhds\n  useHTTPS: true\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Notes\n\n\n\n\nsubscriptionID\n is required, and is the UUID of your Azure subscription\n\n\nresourceGroup\n is required, and is the name of the resource group for your\n  VMs and storage.\n\n\ntenantID\n is required, and is either the domain or UUID for your active\n  directory account within Azure.\n\n\nstorageAccount\n is required, and is the name of the storage account where\n  your disks will be created.\n\n\nstorageAccessKey\n is required, and is a valid access key associated with the\n  \nstorageAccount\n.\n\n\nclientID\n is required, and is the UUID of your client, which was created as\n  an App Registration within your Azure active directory account.\n\n\nclientSecret\n is required if \ncertPath\n is not provided instead. It is a\n  valid access key associated with \nclientID\n, and is managed as part of the App\n  Registration.\n\n\ncertPath\n is an alternative to \nclientSecret\n, contains the location of a\n  PKCS encoded RSA private key associated with \nclientID\n.\n\n\ncontainer\n is optional, and specifies the name of an existing container\n  within \nstorageAccount\n. This container must already exist and is not created\n  automatically.\n\n\nuseHTTPS\n is optional, and is a boolean value on whether to use HTTPS when\n  communicating with the Azure storage endpoint.\n\n\n\n\nRuntime Behavior\n\n\n\n\nThe \ncontainer\n config option defaults to \nvhds\n, and this container is\n  present by default in Azure. Changing this option is only necessary if you\n  want to use a different container within your storage account.\n\n\nVolume Attach/Detach operations in Azure take a long time, sometimes greater\n  than 60 seconds, which is libStorage's default task timeout. When the timeout\n  is hit, libStorage returns information to the caller about a queued task, and\n  that the task is still running. This may cause issues for upstream callers.\n  It is \nhighly\n recommended to adjust this default timeout to 120 seconds by\n  setting the \nlibstorage.server.tasks.exeTimeout\n property. This is done in\n  the \nExamples\n section below.\n\n\n\n\nActivating the Driver\n\n\nTo activate the Azure UD driver please follow the instructions for\n\nactivating storage drivers\n, using \nazureud\n as\nthe driver name.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nAfter creating your app registration, you must go into the\n  \nRequired Permissions\n tab and grant access to \"Windows Azure Service\n  Management API\". Choose the delegated permission for accessing as organization\n  users.\n\n\nYou must also grant your app registration access to your subscription, by\n  going to Subscriptions-\nYour \nsubscriptionID\n-\nAccess Control (IAM). From\n  there, add your app registration as a user, which you will have to search for\n  by name. Grant the role of \"Owner\".\n\n\nYou should carefully check that your VM is compatible with the storage account you want \n  to use. For example, if you need Azure Premium storage your machine should be \n  of a compatible size (e.g. DS_V2, FS). For more details see the available VM \n  \nsizes\n.  \n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nBelow is a full \nconfig.yml\n that works with Azure UD\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    tasks:\n      exeTimeout: 120s\n    services:\n      azure:\n        driver: azureud\n        azureud:\n          subscriptionID: abcdef01-2345-6789-abcd-ef0123456789\n          resourceGroup: testgroup\n          tenantID: usernamehotmail.onmicrosoft.com\n          storageAccount: username\n          storageAccessKey: XXXXXXXX\n          clientID: 123def01-2345-6789-abcd-ef0123456789\n          clientSecret: XXXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot and Copy functionality is not yet implemented\n\n\nThe number of disks you can attach to a Virtual Machine depends on its type.\n\n\nGood resources for reading about disks in Azure are\n  \nhere\n\n  and \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nVirtualBox\n\n\nThe VirtualBox driver registers a storage driver named \nvirtualbox\n with the\nlibStorage service registry and is used by VirtualBox's VMs to connect and\nmanage volumes provided by VirtualBox.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nIn order to leverage the \nvirtualbox\n driver, the \nlibStorage\n client or must\nbe located on each VM that you wish to be able to consume external volumes.\nThe driver leverages the \nvboxwebserv\n HTTP SOAP API which is a process that\nmust be started from the VirtualBox \nhost\n (ie OS X) using\n\nvboxwebsrv -H 0.0.0.0 -v\n or additionally with \n-b\n for running in the\nbackground. This allows the VMs running \nlibStorage\n to remotely make calls to\nthe underlying VirtualBox application. A test for connectivity can be done with\n\ntelnet virtualboxip 18083\n from the VM. The \nvirtualboxip\n is what you\nwould put in the \nendpoint\n value.\n\n\nLeveraging authentication for the VirtualBox webserver is optiona.. The HTTP\nSOAP API can have authentication disabled by running\n\nVBoxManage setproperty websrvauthlibrary null\n.\n\n\nHot-Plugging is required, which limits the usefulness of this driver to \nSATA\n\nonly.  Ensure that your VM has \npre-created\n this controller and it is\nnamed \nSATA\n.  Otherwise the \ncontrollerName\n field must be populated\nwith the name of the controller you wish to use.  The port count must be set\nmanually as it cannot be increased when the VMs are on.  A count of \n30\n\nis suggested.\n\n\nVirtualBox 5.0.10+ must be used.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor a VirtualBox VM to work successfully, the following three points are of\nthe utmost importance:\n\n\n\n\nThe SATA controller should be named \nSATA\n.\n\n\nThe SATA controller's port count must allow for additional\nconnections.\n\n\nThe MAC address must not match that of any other VirtualBox VM's\nMAC addresses or the MAC address of the host.\n\n\n\n\nThe REX-Ray \nVagrantfile\n has\n\na section\n\nthat automatically configures these options.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe following is an example configuration of the VirtualBox driver.\n\nThe \nlocalMachineNameOrId\n parameter is for development use where you force\n\nlibStorage\n to use a specific VM identity.  Choose a \nvolumePath\n to store the\nvolume files or virtual disks.  This path should be created ahead of time.\n\n\nvirtualbox:\n  endpoint: http://virtualboxhost:18083\n  userName: optional\n  password: optional\n  tls: false\n  volumePath: $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n  controllerName: name\n  localMachineNameOrId: forDevelopmentUse\n\n\n\n\nFor information on the equivalent environment variable and CLI flag names\nplease see the section on how non top-level configuration properties are\n\ntransformed\n.\n\n\nActivating the Driver\n\n\nTo activate the VirtualBox driver please follow the instructions for\n\nactivating storage drivers\n,\nusing \nvirtualbox\n as the driver name.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nBelow is a working \nconfig.yml\n file that works with VirtualBox.\n\n\nlibstorage:\n  server:\n    services:\n      virtualbox:\n        driver: virtualbox\n        virtualbox:\n          endpoint:       http://10.0.2.2:18083\n          tls:            false\n          volumePath:     $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes\n          controllerName: SATA\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot and create volume from volume functionality is not available yet\n  with this driver.\n\n\nThe driver supports VirtualBox 5.0.10+",

This makes\nthe document easier to read in text editors. GitHub and ReadTheDocs still\nproduces the proper result when parsing the markdown.\n\n\nAll links to internal resources should be relative.\n\n\nAll links to markdown files should include the file extension.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the below link points to the anchor \nbasic-configuration\n on the\n\nConfiguration\n page:\n\n\n\n\n/user-guide/config#basic-configuration\n\n\nHowever, when the above link is followed when viewing this page directly from\nthe Github repository instead of the generated site documentation, the link\nwill return a 404.\n\n\nWhile it's recommended that users view the generated site documentation instead\nof the source Markdown directly, we can still fix it so that the above link\nwill work regardless. To fix the link, simply make it relative and add the\nMarkdown file extension:\n\n\n\n\n../user-guide/config.md#basic-configuration\n\n\nNow the link will work regardless from where it's viewed.\n\n\nStyle \n Syntax\n\n\nAll source files should be processed by the\n\ngometalinter\n before committed. Any\nerrors or warnings produced by the tools should be corrected before the source\nis committed.\n\n\nIf \nAtom\n is your IDE of choice, install the\n\ngo-plus\n package, and it will execute the\ngometalinter every time a source file is saved.\n\n\nIn lieu of using Atom as the IDE, the project's \nMakefile\n automatically\nexecutes the above tools as part of the build process and will fail the build\nif problems are discovered.\n\n\nCode Coverage\n\n\nAll new work submitted to the project should have associated tests where\napplicable.

The name of the default container is \nbuild-libstorage\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocker-clobber\n\n\nThis target stops and removes all Docker containers that have a name that matches the name of the configured container prefix (default prefix is \nbuild-libstorage\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocker-list\n\n\nLists all Docker containers that have a name that matches the name of the configured prefix (default prefix is \nbuild-libstorage\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Build Options\n\n\nThe following options (via environment variables) can be used to influence\nhow libStorage is built with Docker:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Variable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRIVERS\n\n\nThis variable can be set to a space-delimited list of driver names in order to indicate which storage platforms to support. For example, the command \n$ DRIVERS=\"ebs scaleio\" make docker-build\n would build libStorage for only the EBS and ScaleIO storage platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDBUILD_ONCE\n\n\nWhen set to \n1\n, this environment variable instructs the Makefile to create a temporary, one-time use container for the subsequent build. The container is removed upon a successful build. If the build fails the container is not removed. This is because Makefile error logic is lacking. However, \nmake docker-clobber\n can be used to easily clean up these containers. The containers will follow a given pattern using the container prefix (\nbuild-libstorage\n is the default prefix value). The one-time containers use \nPREFIX-EPOCH\n. For example, \nbuild-libstorage-1474691232\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDGOOS\n\n\nThis sets the OS target for which to build the libStorage binaries. Valid values are \nlinux\n and \ndarwin\n. If omitted the host OS value returned from \nuname -s\n is used instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLOCAL_IMPORTS\n\n\nSpecify a list of space-delimited import paths that will be copied from the host OS's \nGOPATH\n into the container build's vendor area, overriding the dependency code that would normally be fetched by Glide.\nFor example, the project's \nglide.yaml\n file might specify to build REX-Ray with libStorage v0.2.1. However, the following command will build REX-Ray using the libStorage sources on the host OS at \n$GOPATH/src/github.com/codedellemc/libstorage\n:\n$ DLOCAL_IMPORTS=github.com/codedellemc/libstorage make docker-build\nUsing local sources can sometimes present a problem due to missing dependencies. Please see the next environment variable for instructions on how to overcome this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDGLIDE_YAML\n\n\nSpecify a file that will be used for the container build in place of the standard \nglide.yaml\n file.\nThis is necessary for occasions when sources injected into the build via the \nDLOCAL_IMPORTS\n variable import packages that are not imported by the package specified in the project's standard \nglide.yaml\n file.\nFor example, if \nglide.yaml\n specifies that libStorage depends upon AWS SDK v1.2.2, but \nDLOCAL_IMPORTS\n specifies the value \ngithub.com/aws/aws-sdk-go\n and the AWS SDK source code on the host includes a new dependency not present in the v1.2.2 version, Glide will not fetch the new dependency when doing the container build.\nSo it may be necessary to use \nDGLIDE_YAML\n to provide a superset of the project's standard \nglide.yaml\n file which also includes the dependencies necessary to build the packages specified in \nDLOCAL_IMPORTS\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Builds\n\n\nWhile building libStorage with Docker is simple, it ultimately relies on the\nsame \nMakefile\n included in the libStorage repository and so it's entirely\npossible (and often desirable) to build libStorage directly.\n\n\nAdvanced Build Requirements\n\n\nThis project has very few build requirements, but there are still one or two\nitems of which to be aware. Also, please note that this are the requirements to\n\nbuild\n \nlibStorage\n, not run it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirement\n\n\nVersion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating System\n\n\nLinux, OS X\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo\n\n\n=1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGNU Make\n\n\n=3.80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlide\n\n\n=0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX-Code Command Line Tools (OS X only)\n\n\n= OS X 10.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux Kernel Headers (Linux only)\n\n\n=Linux Kernel 3.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGNU C Compiler\n (Linux only)\n\n\n= 4.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerl\n\n\n= 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGit\n\n\n= 1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOS X ships with a very old version of GNU Make, and a package manager like\n\nHomebrew\n can be used to install the required version.\n\n\nIt's also possible to use GCC as the Cgo compiler for OS X or to use Clang on\nLinux, but by default Clang is used on OS X and GCC on Linux.\n\n\nAdvanced Build Targets\n\n\nThe following targets are available when building libStorage directly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuild\n\n\nBuilds libStorage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntest\n\n\nExecutes all of the libStorage tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclean\n\n\nThis target removes all of the source file markers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclobber\n\n\nThis is the same as \nclean\n but also removes any produced artifacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Build Options\n\n\nThe following options (via environment variables) can be used to influence\nhow libStorage is built:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Variable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRIVERS\n\n\nThis variable can be set to a space-delimited list of driver names in order to indicate which storage platforms to support. For example, the command \n$ DRIVERS=\"ebs scaleio\" make build\n would build libStorage for only the EBS and ScaleIO storage platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion File\n\n\nThere is a file at the root of the project named \nVERSION\n. The file contains\na single line with the \ntarget\n version of the project in the file. The version\nfollows the format:\n\n\n(?\nmajor\n\\d+)\\.(?\nminor\n\\d+)\\.(?\npatch\n\\d+)(-rc\\d+)?\n\n\nFor example, during active development of version \n0.1.0\n the file would\ncontain the version \n0.1.0\n. When it's time to create \n0.1.0\n's first\nrelease candidate the version in the file will be changed to \n0.1.0-rc1\n. And\nwhen it's time to release \n0.1.0\n the version is changed back to \n0.1.0\n.\n\n\nSo what's the point of the file if it's basically duplicating the utility of a\ntag? Well, the \nVERSION\n file in fact has two purposes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost updating the \nVERSION\n file with the same value as that\n     of the tag used to create a release provides a single, contextual reason to\n     push a commit and tag. Otherwise some random commit off of \nmaster\n would\n     be tagged as a release candidate or release. Always using the commit that\n     is related to updating the \nVERSION\n file is much cleaner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of the \nVERSION\n file are also used during the build process\n     as a means of overriding the output of a \ngit describe\n. This enables the\n     semantic version injected into the produced binary to be created using\n     the \ntargeted\n version of the next release and not just the value of the\n     last, tagged commit.",
