# libStorage
The libStorage project has been relocated to a subdirectory named
[`libstorage`](https://github.com/codedellemc/rexray/tree/master/libstorage)
at the root of the project [REX-Ray](https://github.com/codedellemc/rexray).
A [subtree merge](http://jasonkarns.com/blog/merge-two-git-repositories-into-one/)
was used in order to retain the original commit history of the libStorage
project.

The first release to include the newly merged libStorage will be
REX-Ray 0.10.0, scheduled tentatively for 2017/09/11. This release
will also include support for the new Container Storage Inteface
([CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec))
specification.

For any questions or concerns please file
[an issue](https://github.com/codedellemc/rexray/issues/new) with
the REX-Ray project or join the Slack channel
[#project-rexray](https://codecommunity.slack.com/messages/proejct-rexray) at
